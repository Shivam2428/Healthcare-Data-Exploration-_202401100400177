 **Overview of the Code**  

This Python program analyzes and visualizes **patient health data** (Blood Pressure, Sugar Level, and Weight) using **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.  

 **Key Functionalities:**  
1. **Data Handling:** Stores patient data in a **Pandas DataFrame**.  
2. **Statistical Analysis:** Uses `df.describe()` to show mean, median, min, max, etc.  
3. **Visualization:**  
   - **Histograms** for Blood Pressure, Sugar Level, and Weight distribution.  
   - **Pairplot** to observe relationships between health metrics.  
   - **Correlation Heatmap** to identify connections between parameters.  

 **Insights:**  
- Helps identify health trends and possible correlations.  
- Can be expanded with **real-world datasets** for deeper analysis.  
- Useful for **early health monitoring and risk assessment**. ðŸš€
